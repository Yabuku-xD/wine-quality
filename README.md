In this project, I worked with Kaggle's Red Wine Quality dataset to create classification models. The goal was to predict whether a red wine can be considered "good quality" or not. Each wine in the dataset is originally assigned a quality score ranging from 0 to 10. To simplify the task, I converted the scores into a binary output: wines with a score of 7 or higher were labeled as "good quality," while wines with a score below 7 were labeled as "not good quality." The classification models were built using 11 input variables that determine the wine's quality.

    Fixed acidity
    Volatile acidity
    Citric acid
    Residual sugar
    Chlorides
    Free sulfur dioxide
    Total sulfur dioxide
    Density
    pH
    Sulfates
    Alcohol

Objectives:

The objectives of this project are as follows:

    To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
    To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine
